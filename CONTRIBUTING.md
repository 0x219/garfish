pnpm build
```

Build with watch mode

```bash

```

The server will restart automatically every time the builds get updated.

## Project Structure

### Monorepo

We use monorepo to manage multiple packages

```js
website
packages
  runtime
    browser-snapshot/          - snapshot sandbox
    browser-vm/                - vm sandbox
    core/                      - core module with sandbox„ÄÅloader„ÄÅhooks„ÄÅrouter
    garfish/
    hooks/                     - hooks
    loader/                    - loader
    remote-module/
    router/                    - router
    utils/                     - common utils
```

## Packaging is introduced

Garfish runtime related packages use the rollup to build and use the same script to build each package, of course, also can be differentiated configuration, in a package under the add below, he has the following fields, the packaging file will be generated to the next, use can be packaged all the core package below

```json
  "buildOptions": {
    "name": "Garfish", // When packaged in umd or esm - browser, for example, will with Garfish namespace injection into the window. Is not specified, use the default name after the package folder to hump
    "devTemplate": "complete", // Choose the template need to debug, complete or module
    "formats": [ // Taking a packaging format
      "umd",
      "cjs",
      "esm-browser",
      "esm-bundler"
    ]
  }
```

We in this piece garfish package, for example to introduce packaging process

```shell
  $ pnpm build garfish -f=umd -n -s -m
```

- `-f`: formatsÔºåSpecify the packaging format
- `-n`: nocheckÔºåDo not check ts type error when packaging
- `-s`: sourcemapÔºåSourcemap is generated after packaging
- `-m`: mergetypesÔºåAfter the completion of the packaging field is a combined type declaration documents
- `-e`: noExternalÔºågarfish Used within the package into a file

#### After packaging file is introduced

- `dist/garfish.cjs.js`: cjs Inside the bag, contain all the warning and prompt information
- `dist/garfish.cjs.prod.js`: cjs Package, all warning messages have been deleted
- `dist/garfish.esm-browser.js`: esm Package, package appears to rely on the son have been scored
- `dist/garfish.esm-bundler.js`: esm Package, the bag, the son of dependence has not been reached, for users with the help of the class webpack packaging tool use
- `dist/garfish.umd.js`: umd Package, compatible with a variety of formats, package dependence were scored
  `

## The operation of the common

```shell
# Debug core/garfish package
$ pnpm dev

# Debug core/sandbox package, and open the debug page in your browser
$ pnpm dev sandbox -o

# Separate packing core/garfish son packages, and the relevant dependent child bag inside, packing real-time monitoring file changes
$ pnpm build garfish -e -w

#  Separate packing core/garfish son packages, and the relevant dependent child bag in, after the merger packaging. Which s
$ pnpm build garfish -e -m

# Pack all the core below package
$ pnpm build:core

# The core and tool below all of the packages
$ pnpm build:all

# Under the core to create a new project
$ pnpm pkg <pkgName>

# Under the tool to create a new project
$ pnpm pkg <pkgName> -t=tool

# Release a latest package (beta, alpha in the same way)
$ pnpm release
```
